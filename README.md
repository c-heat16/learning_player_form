# Implementing Pipeline
1. Fetching data
2. Preparing training data
3. Training player _form_ models
4. Visualizing embeddings

# 1. Fetching Data

To fetch data, simply run the `fetch_data.sh` script (i.e. `bash fetch_data.sh`).
By default, this will collect pitch-by-pitch statcast data for 2015-2019, and seasonal statistics back to 1995.
The script will create a `database` directory and create a database file at `database/mlb.db`. To change where the
database is placed, change the `DB_FP` variable in the `fetch_data.sh` script to the desired location. If you change the
location of the database, please make note if it as you will need it later.

The script utilized two custom "worker" classes, a PyBaseball worker and a SQLWorker.
The PyBaseball workers fetch data via the [PyBaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) library and then pass it to 
an SQLWorker to populate a local database. Pitch-by-pitch data will be collected first, followed by the season-by-season
stats. In total, there will be around 3.6M pitch-by-pitch records, 2k season-by-season pitching records, and 3.7k
season-by-season batting records.
The workers will periodically print their status, ie how many records have been processed and the current date range
being processed. Should only take 10-15 minutes on a modern CPU w/ solid-state storage.

# 2. Preparing Training Data

The first step in creating the training data is to make a single record for each plate appearance in the newly 
constructed database. To do so, simply run the `construct_at_bat_records.sh` script. If you created the database in a
location other than `database/mlb.db` (i.e. you changed `DB_FP` in the `fetch_data.sh` script), please update that for
this script as well. By default, running the script will create a `data/` directory in the repo, and the individual
at-bat records will be placed in the `data/ab_seqs/ab_seqs_v1/` directory, grouped by season. The output location can be
adjusted by modifying the `AB_OUT_DIR` variable in the script.

In a system with a modern CPU and solid-state storage, it will take roughly 4.5 seconds to construct the at-bats for an
individual game. By default, the script will try to utilize 4 threads to construct the records. This can be adjusted
by changing the value of the `N_WORKERS` variable in the `construct_at_bat_records.sh` script. When 16 threads are used,
it will take roughly 1 hours for the script to complete processing. Records for each season will take up about 10.5 GB,
so for all five seasons, so ~55 GB of free space is required.

Once the at-bat records are constructed, the script will begin to aggregate at-bat records by player in chronological
order. First pitchers, then batters. This should only take about a minute or less. By default, the script will create a
`data/player_career_data` directory in the repo and place the output within. If you wish to change the location of the
output, simply change the `CAREER_OUT_DIR` variable in the script.
